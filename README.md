# File Compression Project 
File compression is a project made using Huffman encoding Technique. The various data structures used are map, heaps, tree etc.
This compression file system can also be used for encryption-decryption purposes. This Project basically contracts the size of the file by the use of compression technique . This will be helpful in applications where we have large sized files but we need to compress them for our purposes. 
**Mainly, it is made for use with .txt files. 

## About Huffman Encoding
This problem is that of finding the minimum length bit string which can be used to encode a string of symbols. One application is text compression:
What's the smallest number of bits (hence the minimum size of file) we can use to store an arbitrary piece of text?

Huffman's scheme uses a table of frequency of occurrence for each symbol (or character) in the input. This table may be derived from the input itself or from data which is representative of the input. For instance, the frequency of occurrence of letters in normal English might be derived from processing a large number of text documents and then used for encoding all text documents. We then need to assign a variable-length bit string to each character that unambiguously represents that character. This means that the encoding for each character must have a unique prefix. If the characters to be encoded are arranged in a binary tree:

For example:
    String   Encoding
    TEA    10 00 010
    SEA    011 00 010
    TEN    10 00 110
