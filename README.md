# File Compression Project 
File compression using huffman encoding and used data structures such as heap,map
This compression file system can also be used for encryption-decryption purposes. This Project basically contracts the size of the file by the use of compression technique . This will be helpful in applications where we have large sized files but we need to compress them for our purposes.
